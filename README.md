# **AI-Generated SFML Game Comparison (Feb 2025)**  

This project compares the **C++ game development capabilities** of two AI models: **ChatGPT (o3-mini-high)** and **DeepSeek (DeepThink R1)**. Both AIs were given the **same prompt** to generate a **simple 2D platformer** using SFML. This test was conducted in **February 2025** to evaluate how well these AI models can generate functional C++ game code.  

---

## **Prompt Given to Both AIs**
```
Write a simple 2D platform-style game using SFML, where the player controls a basic square that can move left, right, and jump, similar to Mario. There will be enemies that can be defeated by jumping on their heads. The level will be procedurally generated and infinite, with the game recording the maximum distance the player travels forward.
```

## **Setup & Build Instructions**
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPTVsDeepSeek
   cd GPTVsDeepSeek
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (Using vcpkg)**  
   ```
   vcpkg install
   ```

3. **Build the Project with CMake**
   ```
   cmake --preset=default
   cmake --build --preset=default
   ```

## **Observations & Results**
- **DeepSeek (DeepThink R1)**
  - The game launched, and the player could move and jump.
  - **Issues**:
    - The **level was not truly infinite**—it stopped generating new platforms.
    - **Enemies floated** instead of walking on platforms.
    - **Falling reset the game**, but distance tracking didn’t work properly.

- **ChatGPT (o3-mini-high)**
  - The game **felt smoother and more polished**.
  - Platforms were **procedurally generated correctly** for an **infinite level**.
  - **Enemies behaved properly**, and jumping on them defeated them.
  - **Distance tracking worked as expected**.

**Conclusion:** ChatGPT o3 produced a more **functional and structured** game, making it the better AI for this challenge.
